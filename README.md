# FRIDAY-JAVA
NLP interface for IoT 

The Src folder doesn't include the required libraries :( 
add a libraries folder from here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11mN8ThTijDQ9fm833ay2pgQIvIEoTyq_?usp=sharing
All libraries are open source and active so its advisable to get new versions if possible

# Current functionality
- Find all nodes on a local network
- Communication by http with nodemcu (or other ESP microcontroller)
- CMUSphinx Voice Recognition

FRIDAY is my ongoing attempt at creating an AI. The main functionality is around web interfacing and typical PA type things, but the eventual goal is to combine this with learning algorithms that will allow FRIDAY's activity to be intuitively programmed by the user.
